# Ralphie?

This library was nearly named `bb-gun` as a reference to `babashka`'s `bb`
command. I left it to squat less on `bb`, as this is more of an application
than library. But be warned, this one will shoot your eye out!

This mostly speaks to Ralphie knowing he wants to write something in Babashka,
whether there are bears near Pulaski's or not.
