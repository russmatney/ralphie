* Ralphie

#+BEGIN_SRC A Christmas Story
    Ralphie as Adult: [narrating] Meanwhile, I struggled for exactly the right
    BB gun hint. It had to be firm, but subtle.

    Ralphie: Flick says he saw some grizzly bears near Pulaski's candy store!

    [Everyone stares at Ralphie]

    Ralphie as Adult: [narrating] They looked at me as if I had lobsters
    crawling out of my ears.
#+END_SRC

Maybe the bears are real, maybe not. Either way, Ralphie knew he wanted to shoot
a BB gun, same as I knew I wanted to write a tool in Babashka.
