#+TITLE: Ralphie

A set of tools for cli and keybindings, written in
Clojure/[[https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/][Babashka]].

* Ralphie

This library was nearly named `bb-gun` as a reference to `babashka`'s `bb`
command. I left it to squat less on `bb`, as this is more of an application
than library. But be warned, this one will shoot your eye out!

#+BEGIN_SRC A Christmas Story
    Ralphie as Adult: [narrating] Meanwhile, I struggled for exactly the right
    BB gun hint. It had to be firm, but subtle.

    Ralphie: Flick says he saw some grizzly bears near Pulaski's candy store!

    [Everyone stares at Ralphie]

    Ralphie as Adult: [narrating] They looked at me as if I had lobsters
    crawling out of my ears.
#+END_SRC

This mostly speaks to Ralphie knowing he wants to write something in Babashka,
whether there are bears near Pulaski's or not.
